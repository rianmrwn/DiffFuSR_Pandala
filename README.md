## 0. Environment setup 

```bash
# ❶ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) Python version used 3.11.4
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# ❷ Install all Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To directly download and test our pretrained checkpoints, skip diretly to Step 2a.

## 1. Train the Super-Resolution (SR) models

### 1 a. Prepare training data

| Dataset       | What to download                                                                 | Destination                     |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| NAIP Synthetic | *.tif tiles from https://huggingface.co/datasets/isp-uv-es/SEN2NAIP/tree/main/synthetic | load/naip/synthetic_naip/      |
| WorldStrat    | *.tif files from https://worldstrat.github.io/                                   | load/WorldStrat_raw/           |

Make sure only TIFF files are placed in the folders above.

### 1 b. Run the training script three times

```bash
python 1_train_sr.py --config configs/blindsrsnf_aniso_naip_degraded_harm_large.yaml
python 1_train_sr.py --config configs/blindsrsnf_aniso_naip_degraded_not_harm_large.yaml
python 1_train_sr.py --config configs/blindsrsnf_aniso_worldstrat_degraded_harmfac_10000_large.yaml
```

Each run will create a Lightning log directory such as `logs/blindsrsnf_aniso_naip_degraded_harm_large/`.

## 2. Test the SR models on OpenSR-Test

### 2 a. Download the test set



```bash
python download_opensr_test.py
```

### 2 b. Split Gather all LR/HR pairs to a common folder
It will use lr_files_list.txt to dump all low and high resolution images.

```bash
python 0_prepare_open_sr_test_data.py 
```

### 2 c. Place pretrained checkpoints
The following checkpoints are available:
- WorldStrat SR
- NAIP-no-harm SR (No Harmonization)
- NAIP-harm SR (with harmonization)
Checkpoints are stored at [https://huggingface.co/NorskRegnesentralSTI/DiffFuSR](https://huggingface.co/NorskRegnesentralSTI/DiffFuSR). Download them using:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/NorskRegnesentralSTI/DiffFuSR && mv DiffFuSR/logs logs
```

### 2 d. Run the RGB test script needed for open sr test

```bash
python 2_test_rgb_for_opensr_metric.py
```
`--checkpoint` flag can be changed to test all three models. WorldStrat SR, NAIP-no-harm SR (No Harmonization) and  NAIP-harm SR (with harmonization).
SR outputs are saved under the corresponding `logs/.../sr/` directory.

### 2 e. Re-package results for Open SR metric computation
it will produce folder diffsr in logs folder which will be used in next step.
```bash
python 3_preprocess_for_opensrtest.py
```

### 2 f. Compute OpenSR metrics

Change the path_diffsr appropriately. This script will create the open sr metrics for the three SR evaluation tables (TABLE I to TABLE III). We follow open-SR test documentation to correctly set all experiment setting. These can be changed as required. 

e.g. path_diffsr = "logs/blindsrsnf_aniso_worldstrat_degraded_harmfac_10000_large/version_7/results/worldstrat/diffsr"

```bash
python 4_opensr.py 
```

The script writes a CSV file with OpenSR metrics. Open it in and process in Excel to obtain averages and variance across all test images. 

## 3. Train the Fusion (multispectral) model
Train Fusion Model, by using data from Norwegian computing Center project FM4CS. The data is not released yet but the list of tiles used in included.
 The list of tiles used is in the text file. The data has not been released but any Sentinel-2 data can be used to train this as long as you have very large tiles available for sampling.

Input tiles: list is in `list_fusion_train.txt` .



Run:

```bash
python 5_train_fusion.py 
```

The model checkpoints are saved in `logs/GSD/`.

## 4. Test the complete SR + Fusion pipeline
Test using pretrained model using and the comlete super-resolutiona nd fusion pipeline. Select the correct flag desired. Either use Gram Schmidt or Neural Network for fusion. For neural network a pre-trained weight are required. Also chose the super-resolution model to be used.

Downloads weight for fusion module must be in `logs/GSD/`.

```bash
python 6_test_multispectral_SR_fuse.py 
 
```

## 5. Benchmark the full pipeline
to bechmark the whole SR + fusion pipeline. This will generate the Last table in the paper. TABLE IV
```bash
python 7_benchmark_DiffFuSR.py
```

The script prints all metrics

## Folder layout (summary)

```bash
load/
├─ naip/synthetic_naip/          # NAIP synthetic TIFFs
├─ WorldStrat_raw/               # WorldStrat raw TIFFs
└─ opensrtest/100/
   ├─ lr/                        # auto-generated
   └─ hr/                        # auto-generated

logs/
